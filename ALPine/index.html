        <p id="text">I like to play video games, taking funny pictures of my dog (I have a lot of them), and spending time with my family. I also like readdownload.pnging books like WoF and Warriors because they are good and don't judge me and I dont reccomend reading it to the class because of some... reasons. Like this one. There is a lot more blood than that in the book series, though.</p>
